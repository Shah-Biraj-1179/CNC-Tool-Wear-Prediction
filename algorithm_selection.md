# Algorithm Selection for CNC Tool Wear Prediction

## What are Machine Learning Algorithms?

Machine learning algorithms are mathematical procedures that automatically find patterns in data and use those patterns to make predictions. Think of them as different approaches to learning from examples, similar to how students might use different study methods to learn the same subject.

For our CNC tool wear prediction project, we need algorithms that can:
- Handle numerical sensor data effectively
- Learn complex relationships between multiple sensors
- Make accurate predictions in real-time
- Provide reliable results for industrial applications

## Our Three Selected Algorithms

### Algorithm 1: Random Forest

#### What Random Forest Is
Random Forest creates many decision trees and combines their predictions. It's like asking 100 different experts for their opinion and taking the majority vote. Each expert (tree) looks at different aspects of the data and makes their own prediction.

#### How Random Forest Works

**Step 1: Create Multiple Decision Trees**
The algorithm creates 100-500 individual decision trees. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and uses a random selection of sensor features.

**Step 2: Individual Tree Decision Process**
Each tree makes decisions using if-then rules:
```
Tree 1 Logic:
If vibration > 3.0:
    If temperature > 50:
        If cutting_force > 600:
            Prediction: High wear (0.8)
        Else:
            Prediction: Medium wear (0.6)
    Else:
        Prediction: Low wear (0.3)
Else:
    If cutting_force > 400:
        Prediction: Medium wear (0.5)
    Else:
        Prediction: Low wear (0.2)

Tree 2 Logic:
If cutting_force > 500:
    If spindle_speed > 3000:
        Prediction: High wear (0.7)
    Else:
        Prediction: Medium wear (0.5)
Else:
    If vibration > 2.5:
        Prediction: Medium wear (0.4)
    Else:
        Prediction: Low wear (0.1)
```

**Step 3: Combine All Predictions**
Final prediction = Average of all tree predictions
Example: (0.8 + 0.7 + 0.6 + 0.5 + 0.9) ÷ 5 = 0.7

#### Strengths of Random Forest
- **Easy to Understand**: Decision trees mirror human reasoning
- **Handles Noise Well**: Multiple trees reduce impact of sensor errors
- **Feature Importance**: Shows which sensors are most important for predictions
- **Fast Training**: Can be trained quickly on large datasets
- **Robust Performance**: Works well across different types of manufacturing conditions
- **No Overfitting**: Multiple trees prevent memorizing specific examples

#### Weaknesses of Random Forest
- **Memory Usage**: Stores many trees, requiring more computer memory
- **Less Accurate**: May not achieve the highest possible accuracy
- **Large Model Size**: The saved model file can be quite large

#### When to Use Random Forest
- **First ML Project**: When you're new to machine learning
- **Need Explanations**: When management wants to understand how predictions work
- **Noisy Data**: When sensor data has measurement errors or interference
- **Quick Results**: When you need a working model fast
- **Limited Computing**: When training time and resources are constrained

#### Technical Parameters for Random Forest
```python
n_estimators = 100        # Number of trees (more trees = better accuracy, slower speed)
max_depth = None          # How deep each tree can grow (None = unlimited)
min_samples_split = 5     # Minimum samples needed to split a node
max_features = 'sqrt'     # Number of features each tree considers
random_state = 42         # For reproducible results
n_jobs = -1              # Use all CPU cores for faster training
```

### Algorithm 2: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

#### What SVM Is
SVM finds the best mathematical boundary to separate different levels of tool wear. Imagine plotting all your data points on a graph where each axis represents a sensor reading, then drawing the optimal line or curve that best distinguishes between worn and new tools.

#### How SVM Works

**Step 1: Plot Data in Multi-dimensional Space**
Each tool measurement becomes a point in space where:
- X-axis = vibration
- Y-axis = temperature  
- Z-axis = cutting force
- Additional dimensions for other sensors

**Step 2: Find Optimal Boundary**
SVM searches for the best line, curve, or surface that separates high-wear tools from low-wear tools:
```
High Wear Tools: ●●●●●●●
                    |  <- SVM draws this boundary
Low Wear Tools:  ○○○○○○○
```

**Step 3: Use Boundary for New Predictions**
When new sensor data arrives, SVM checks which side of the boundary it falls on to make a prediction.

#### Mathematical Kernels
SVM can create different types of boundaries:

**Linear Kernel**: Straight line boundary
- Good for: Simple, linearly separable data
- Fast computation, easy to interpret

**Polynomial Kernel**: Curved boundary
- Good for: Moderately complex relationships
- Can model curves and bends in data patterns

**RBF (Radial Basis Function) Kernel**: Complex curved boundary  
- Good for: Complex, non-linear sensor relationships
- Most flexible, can handle intricate patterns

#### Strengths of SVM
- **High Accuracy**: Often achieves excellent prediction accuracy
- **Works with Limited Data**: Effective even with smaller datasets
- **Mathematically Rigorous**: Strong theoretical foundation
- **Memory Efficient**: Stores only key data points (support vectors)
- **Handles Complex Patterns**: Can learn intricate sensor relationships

#### Weaknesses of SVM
- **Hard to Interpret**: Difficult to explain predictions to non-technical users
- **Sensitive to Scale**: Requires careful data preprocessing
- **Parameter Tuning**: Needs expert knowledge to set parameters correctly
- **Slower Training**: Takes longer to train on large datasets

#### When to Use SVM
- **Limited Training Data**: When you have less than 1000 training examples
- **Complex Sensor Relationships**: When sensors interact in non-linear ways
- **High Accuracy Needed**: When prediction accuracy is critical
- **Mathematical Precision**: When you need theoretically sound methods

#### Technical Parameters for SVM
```python
kernel = 'rbf'           # Type of boundary (linear, poly, rbf)
C = 1.0                  # Regularization strength (how strict the boundary)
gamma = 'scale'          # Kernel coefficient (how far influence reaches)
epsilon = 0.1            # Tolerance for stopping criterion
```

### Algorithm 3: Gradient Boosting

#### What Gradient Boosting Is
Gradient Boosting builds models sequentially, where each new model corrects the mistakes of previous models. It's like learning from errors to continuously improve, similar to how students review wrong answers to get better at tests.

#### How Gradient Boosting Works

**Step 1: Start with Simple Prediction**
Begin with a basic guess (often the average wear level):
```
Initial prediction for all tools: 0.5 (average wear)
```

**Step 2: Measure Errors**
Calculate how wrong the initial prediction was for each tool:
```
Tool T001: Actual = 0.8, Predicted = 0.5, Error = +0.3
Tool T002: Actual = 0.2, Predicted = 0.5, Error = -0.3
Tool T003: Actual = 0.6, Predicted = 0.5, Error = +0.1
```

**Step 3: Build Model to Predict Errors**
Create a new model that tries to predict these errors based on sensor data:
```
If vibration > 3.0 and temperature > 55:
    Error prediction = +0.3
If vibration < 2.0 and force < 300:
    Error prediction = -0.2
```

**Step 4: Combine Predictions**
New prediction = Original prediction + Error correction
```
Tool T001: 0.5 + 0.3 = 0.8 (much better!)
```

**Step 5: Repeat Process**
Continue building models to correct remaining errors, typically 100-1000 iterations.

**Step 6: Final Prediction**
Combine all models for the final prediction:
```
Final prediction = Initial + Correction1 + Correction2 + ... + Correction100
```

#### Strengths of Gradient Boosting
- **Highest Accuracy**: Often achieves the best prediction performance
- **Learns Complex Patterns**: Automatically discovers intricate sensor relationships
- **Handles Mixed Data Types**: Works well with different types of features
- **Feature Selection**: Automatically identifies most important sensors
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Used in many winning machine learning competitions

#### Weaknesses of Gradient Boosting
- **Longest Training Time**: Can take hours to train on large datasets
- **Overfitting Risk**: Can memorize training data if not careful
- **Complex to Tune**: Many parameters need careful adjustment
- **Hard to Interpret**: Difficult to explain individual predictions
- **Computational Requirements**: Needs significant computing resources

#### When to Use Gradient Boosting
- **Maximum Accuracy Required**: When prediction accuracy is the top priority
- **Large Dataset Available**: When you have 10,000+ training examples
- **Production System**: When system will run continuously with good hardware
- **Competition/Benchmark**: When trying to achieve best possible performance

#### Technical Parameters for Gradient Boosting
```python
learning_rate = 0.1      # How fast to learn (0.01-0.3, slower often better)
n_estimators = 100       # Number of sequential models (100-1000)
max_depth = 3           # Complexity of individual models
subsample = 0.8         # Fraction of data each model sees
validation_fraction = 0.1 # Data reserved for early stopping
```
